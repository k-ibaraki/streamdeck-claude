 * nor `WSL_DISTRO_NAME` is set. To keep the bundle portable, rollup's
 * `inject-build-env` transform replaces the two `__BUILD_*__` sentinels below
 * with whatever values were live at build time (which always runs from WSL).
 * At runtime, real env vars take precedence; the baked defaults are the
 * fallback.
 *
 * If the sentinels somehow survived the build (e.g. running an unbuilt module
 * directly), `assertResolved` catches it before any path is constructed.
